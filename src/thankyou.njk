      I honestly can't believe we're here. When I started this crazy journey with just a few old computers and a dream, I never imagined we'd grow into what we are today - a real museum with 25,000+ artifacts, serving thousands of visitors, and now with our very own building in Pittsburgh!
    </p>
    <p>
      This move wouldn't have been possible without YOU - our incredible supporters, volunteers, visitors, donors, and the entire retro computing community. Every Facebook share, every Patreon subscription, every visit, every donation, every word of encouragement... it all added up to this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went from a pop-up museum bouncing around different locations to having our own permanent space where we can really show off this amazing collection and create the interactive experiences I've always dreamed of. School groups can come learn about tech history, families can discover vintage games together, and researchers can dive deep into computing heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Thank you for believing in this vision.</b> Thank you for supporting a weird little museum dedicated to preserving electronic entertainment history. Thank you for helping us prove that retro computing and gaming culture matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adventure is just beginning! Come visit us in Penn Hills - I can't wait to show you around our new home.
