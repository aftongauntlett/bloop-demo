  <h2>About Bloop Museum</h2>
  <p>Bloop is a retro-tech and gaming museum dedicated to preserving vintage electronics, games, and media formats.</p>
  <p>We've been operating for over 17 years, now located in Penn Hills near Monroeville, PA.</p>
  <p>Visit, volunteer, or just enjoy the blinking lights and the sweet sound of a floppy drive grinding away.</p>

  <p>Bloop isn’t just a museum — it’s a shrine to the glorious past of technology.</p>
  <p>We've recovered lost BIOSes, saved innocent floppy disks from extinction, and held over 5,000 tours for curious minds.</p>
  <p>If it hums, glows, clicks, or boots from a disk — we probably have it.</p>

  <p>Bloop is an interactive archive of digital artifacts. From ancient sound cards to forgotten bootleg consoles, we preserve it all.</p>
  <p>We also contribute to online databases, host local workshops, and absolutely love when kids gasp at CRTs.</p>
