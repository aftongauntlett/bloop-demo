      <b>What's a Bloop?</b> We're an electronic entertainment museum dedicated to computers, games, media, and gadgets! We currently operate inside the
      <a href="http://museum.syssrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">System Source Computer Museum</a> near Baltimore, adding fun and flair to their exhibits. The
      <a href="https://www.nationalelectronicsmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Electronics Museum</a>
      also moved in, so when you visit, you get a personalized tour of all three museums.

     We've run Bloop as a pop-up museum for over 17 years, and brick-and-mortar for seven. Success means growth, and we're excited about our new Pittsburgh location!
